Clune Park is in Port Glasgow, Scotland. It is very old. Long ago, workers live there. But when jobs end, they leave.

Now most homes are empty and broken. Some homes are very cheap. People call Clune Park Scotlandâ€™s Chernobyl because it looks scary. Some people still live there. One man is happy and does not want to leave. The city wants to take down old homes and build 165 new ones.

The place has a lot of history. Some people feel sad. But many hope new homes will help the area.

Difficult words: empty (with nothing inside), take down (to knock down an old building), history (things which happen in the past).
